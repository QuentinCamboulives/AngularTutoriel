# AngularFormation


## How to run the project 

Run this command to start the fake DB.
```bash
npx json-server --watch db.json
```
Then, run
```
ng serve
```

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.  
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.  
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
